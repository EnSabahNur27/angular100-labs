hi Matt

part 1

find a mini sale icon image and save to this folder

then in the lab solution, use ngIf for the logic that if it is onsale to display the icon.

part 2

getting you an example but using ngswitch to switch between displays

i need a third the eample is card, list and map

Another good example here is to have a cardview and a list view, and toggle between them where one goes on and one goes off.
