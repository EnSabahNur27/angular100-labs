in the app.component.html file
refer to the three albums by using
albumsArray[0]
albumsArray[1]
albumsArray[2]

and accessing the properties

for each album use this bootstrap styling and structure

put code here for card - can copy from the React album project

SHOULD THIS JUST BE ONE? instead of forcing them to repeat?
